    extendedNarrative: [
      "You center the people AI border technology is deployed against — stateless people, asylum seekers, migrants — rather than the states and companies deploying it. Biometric scanning at reception centers, automated risk-scoring of asylum claims, drones patrolling the US/Mexico and Kenya/Somalia borders, surveillance infrastructure ringing EU camps: to you these aren't edge cases of an otherwise promising technology, they're its actual, current, dominant use in this domain, and the people it's used on had no say in its design.",
      "You reject the framing that caution about AI costs lives, at least as it's usually deployed. Petra Molnar's empirical work, gathered as a lawyer and anthropologist with the Refugee Law Lab at York University and laid out in The Walls Have Eyes, runs the argument in the opposite direction for a different population: unaccountable, fast-moving AI deployment against refugees and migrants is what's actually costing lives and due process right now, not a hypothetical harm to weigh against hypothetical benefit.",
      "Your fight isn't for a population trying to build or control its own AI capacity — it's accountability for how AI already gets used against people with the least power on earth to contest it.",
    ],
    shadowSide: "Centering accountability for how AI gets deployed against migrants doesn't, by itself, specify what should replace biometric screening or automated risk-scoring at borders under real strain. Documenting harm isn't the same as proposing a workable alternative, and this critique can read as opposing any AI tool at the border without fully engaging the real processing backlogs and chronic understaffing that push states toward automation in the first place.",

      mindAssumption: "You're likely assuming that whether an automated system is conscious matters far less than the very real, very present harm it causes when used to sort, flag, or detain a human being at a border.",
      laborAssumption: "You're likely assuming that AI's economic disruption is a secondary concern next to the more immediate question of due process and survival for people already at the sharpest edge of state power.",
      connectionAssumption: "You're likely assuming that AI companionship is a distant concern next to a system that treats the people it's deployed against as risk scores to be sorted, not potential relationship partners.",
